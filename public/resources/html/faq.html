<h4>Why are you asking me for a location?</h4>
<div>We produce hundreds of local streams across the country and we use your location to match you with the most local and relevant stream. Why isn't my location on the list of streams? When will my town be added? Sorry if we haven't made it to your location yet. We're in over 200 locations across the country and working hard to expand. <a href="https://localnow.com/#/appcontact">Tell us</a> where you live.</div>

<h4>Why do some locations have more coverage than others?</h4>
<div>Local Now's editorial team is creating as much video for as many locations in the U.S. as possible. We're on a mission to bring you the best coverage as we grow, but we have to start somewhere! So certain areas will have more stories and coverage than others. <a href="https://localnow.com/#/appcontact">Tell us</a> where you live.</div>
